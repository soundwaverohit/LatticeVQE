Hamiltonian Description
This implementation of a Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) constructs a Hamiltonian with SU(3) symmetry on a 2D lattice, designed for use in a quantum lattice gauge theory simulation. The Hamiltonian includes hopping terms and on-site mass terms to model fermionic interactions in an SU(3) gauge theory.
